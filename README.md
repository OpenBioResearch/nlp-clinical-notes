# nlp-clinical-notes

## Project Overview

This repo showcases Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects focused on  techniques to analyze clinical note dataset. BioBert, ClinicalBert and medacy are leveraged due to their biomedical domain specificity.

The notebooks are focused on gaining insights from clinician notes through entity recognition, sentiment analysis, relation extraction, and topic modeling and to a lesser extent of building a predictive model to detect sepsis

## Setup

Download the training and validation datasets and install the following packages with the command:
